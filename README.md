## About
NewsPortal is a web application that collects online news articles from a variety of reputable sources and displays them all in one infinite scrolling webpage. Each article is presented as a card that displays important information such as article title, description, and publisher in a standardised format for easy reading. Each article is linked to the publisher's domain, so users just need to click on an article to read more. Searches can be can customised by providing specific search queries and filtering the results returned.

At writing, the developer is a 2nd year university student. The purpose of creating NewsPortal was to learn the basics of API requests and front-end web development in a self-learning environment, as preparation for future university modules. NewsPortal was created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).
